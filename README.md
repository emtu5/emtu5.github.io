My personal website. Doubles as my uni WebTech project lol

# New in Version 2
- A lot of JS stuff, including interactive carousels for images, a Jewel Quest Heritage level editor (far from finished however, it lacks quite a few features and I must admit it's still quite janky, it's about as media responsive as a tin can), and a sound-making adorable creature (a cat-shaped doodle that makes weird noises and shares their wisdom on the homepage)
- I'd say the centerpiece is definitely the JQH editor (uses many of the things we learned, such as events, the canvas element, forms and so on), and I do want to polish it out eventually (there's still so many things to add
- I also really like the little slideshows for images, they feel nice to go through. The things that are missing are nice animations and better CSS (honestly, the "better CSS" part applies to the whole project, I'm not the biggest CSS fan lol)
